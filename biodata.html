            <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
            <p>Hello everyone, my name is Amia! My friends usually call me "Am", "Mi", or "Mia", but I'm fine with whichever. I was born on the 18th May 2007 in Jakarta, Indonesia. Right now I am 14 years old, and I am a 9th grader in <a href="https://kebayoran.labschool-unj.sch.id/">SMP Labschool Kebayoran.</a></p>
            <p>All my life, I never really had a hobby or interest and I just kind of tried everything. I tried gymnastics, figure-skating, dancing, singing, drawing, and so much more. But only now do I have an actual hobby. I really enjoy doing my make-up in my free time, and I also love listening to music.</p>
            <p>Other than that, I love spending time with my family. During quarantine, I don't really meet up with my friends anymore and just stay home with my family. </p>
            <p>To be honest, I'm not really sure what I want to do in the future. I have interest in design and journalism, but I'll just explore more things while I still can.</p>
            <p>Anyway, that's all from this page. I hope you all enjoy the rest of my blog!
